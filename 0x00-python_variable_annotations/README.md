# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations## Tasks

### 0. Basic annotations - add

Write a type-annotated function `add` that takes two floats `a` and `b` as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

### 1. Basic annotations - concat

Write a type-annotated function `concat` that takes two strings `str1` and `str2` as arguments and returns their concatenation.

### 2. Basic annotations - floor

Write a type-annotated function `floor` that takes a float `n` as an argument and returns its floor as an integer.

### 3. Basic annotations - to string

Write a type-annotated function `to_str` that takes a float `n` as an argument and returns its string representation.

### 4. Define variables

Define and annotate variables with the specified values:
- `a`: an integer with a value of `1`
- `pi`: a float with a value of `3.14`
- `i_understand_annotations`: a boolean with a value of `True`
- `school`: a string with a value of “Holberton”

### 5. Complex types - list of floats

Write a type-annotated function `sum_list` that takes a list of floats as an argument and returns their sum as a float.

### 6. Complex types - mixed list

Write a type-annotated function `sum_mixed_list` that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

### 7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple

Write a type-annotated function `to_kv` that takes a string `k` and an int OR float `v` as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string `k`, and the second element is the square of the int/float `v`.

### 8. Complex types - functions

Write a type-annotated function `make_multiplier` that takes a float `multiplier` as an argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by `multiplier`.

### 9. Let's duck type an iterable object

Annotate the `element_length` function's parameters and return values with the appropriate types.
